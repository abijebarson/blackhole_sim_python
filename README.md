# Blackhole for poor people

[This guy](https://github.com/kavan010) made the same [here](https://youtu.be/8-B6ryuBkCM?si=FZ5Q98ncbUAoMxH_) in C++. It required GPU. I am poor and I don't have a GPU. So I made it in python to only use CPU to render it as an image (because I'm busy).

This was heavily inspired by [his project](https://github.com/kavan010/black_hole). I did change a little like using G=c=1 instead of real SI unit values to not anger the floating-point Gods, euler method instead of rk4(I think he did euler too). Rest math is same. Just run the script after installing the requirements... done!

I might rewrite the README.md later.
